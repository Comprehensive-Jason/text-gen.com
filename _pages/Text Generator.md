## What is the difference between using Text Generator and other AI Writers?

 **Text Generator Plugin** works besides [[Obsidian]] which is a powerful knowledge organization and management tool.  In contrast with other AI writing solutions:
* You're only paying for the third provider's services. 
* You have a lot of control over how these services work through [[Frontmatter Configuration]] and [[Considered Context]],
* You can browse and add new use cases as you need them through [[Templates]] and **Community Templates**.
